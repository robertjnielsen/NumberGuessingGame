# NumberGuessingGame
Simple number guessing game console app to help learn C# and .NET Core.

## What It Is

This is a simple console game where the user is asked to guess a correct number between 1 and 10. Results will be displayed depending on if the user guessed correctly or not.

## My Inspiration

This simple project is based on a tutorial by Brad Traversy to help me start to learn C# and the .NET / .NET Core framework(s).

## How I Made It

This project was developed in Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.
